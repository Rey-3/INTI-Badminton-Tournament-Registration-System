The INTI Badminton Club is organizing a tournament and is seeking a simple software solution to manage participant registrations. This system is designed to store and manage registration records for up to 50 participants. Each registration record contains essential information about the participant, such as their unique ID, name, age, contact number, club membership status, and category code, which defines their group: Junior, Senior, or Open.

The system offers a user-friendly menu with four main options: adding new registrations, editing existing registrations, viewing a summary report, and exiting the system. In the "Add New Registration" module, users can input participant details, including validating data to ensure that all fields are filled, IDs are unique, and the category matches the participant's age. Additionally, the system allows users to generate a receipt in a file format if requested. The receipt includes the registration details, fees, any applicable discounts for club members, and the total amount paid.

The "Edit Registration" module enables users to modify participant details, excluding their ID. The "View Summary Report" module provides a submenu with two options: listing all participants in a particular category and generating a registration summary report. The summary report shows the number of participants in each category and the total fees collected, represented visually using a line of asterisks.

The system also ensures that no further registrations can be made once the maximum limit of 50 participants is reached, prompting a "registration is full" message. This software solution is essential for the efficient and organized management of tournament registrations, providing clear user interaction and data validation, and ensuring a smooth and error-free experience for both organizers and participants.
